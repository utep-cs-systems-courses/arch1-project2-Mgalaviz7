# Lab 2: Blinky-Buzzy Toy

For my toy there is use of all buttons.

Button1: When pressed blinks lights accordind to an incresing binary fasion
from the value 00 base2 to the value 11 base2.

Button2: When pressed keeps the the prior count_to_3 active but make them
randomly dim.

Button3: When pressed this button interupts all current states to a state in
which eveything is set to off.

Button4: When pressed is used to play the Little Lamb Lullaby as well as
breafly interrupt the state it is currently on and plays the medlody and the
continues the state that was prior to pressing button4 after melody has finished.
